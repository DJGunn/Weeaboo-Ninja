Desc:
Weeaboo ninja is a silly little game about a ninja who's only source of joy and happiness is stolen from him. He must then go on a mission to kill those ninjas that kidnapped his love. After defeating the RNG-produced number of ninjas (5-11), he saves the day and recovers his love. Alternatively if he gets hit 5 times, he dies.

Controls are WASD to move, mouse to aim, left click to fire.

Desired Feelings:
At first I just wanted the player to feel a sense of comic relief, but as I actually started developing the game, my desire for the player transformed. I'm no longer concerned with the player finding the game funny. But rather I want to surprise the player with the amount of detail that went into making this silly little game. I want the player to be surprised and delighted by the start screen, and surprised by the sometimes surprisingly agile enemy ninjas. I want the player to have a fully, self contained experience from start to finish in the span of just a few minutes.
