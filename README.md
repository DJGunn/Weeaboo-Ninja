Desc:

Weeaboo ninja is a silly little game about a ninja who's only source of joy and happiness is stolen from him. He must then go on a mission to kill those ninjas that kidnapped his love. After defeating the RNG-produced number of ninjas (5-11), he saves the day and recovers his love. Alternatively if he gets hit 5 times, he dies.




Controls are WASD to move, mouse to aim, left click to fire.
